# UIs

Originally where UIs were, now moved to separate repos see main README for details.

# einkweb

Is a minimal eink browser implementation targeting Generation 1 Kindle devices, but also works on modern browsers and Andriod.  Needs update to work on the latest streams. Don't use for the moment.

# wwwroot

A convenience for serving the UIs, adjust symbolic links in src to point to where they are cloned and run

    npmstart
